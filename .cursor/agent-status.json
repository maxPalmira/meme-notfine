  "notes": "PM CRITICAL FAILURE RESOLVED: Dev had completed all major components (HeaderNavigation, HeroSection, CASection) with comprehensive testing, but components were NEVER INTEGRATED into the main page. This created illusion of incomplete work when all functionality existed but was unused. Fixed by properly importing and using all completed components. All SVG navigation, hero positioning, and CA copy functionality now active."
