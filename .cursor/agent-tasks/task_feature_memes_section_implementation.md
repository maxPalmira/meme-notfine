# Task: Memes Section Implementation

## Task Type: feature
**Created**: 2025-01-21  
**Status**: CREATED  
**Assigned Branch**: feature/ca-section-implementation  
**Priority**: MEDIUM - NEW SECTION  

## Figma Reference
**Design URL**: https://www.figma.com/design/PZCXc4tndOeY0qkZpvZTaX/-NOTFINE?node-id=266-13&t=XQnurgaDv6JG4BcW-4

## Objective
Implement the Memes section with proper SVG integration, layout matching, and full application integration following the improved PM process.

## Definition of Done - MANDATORY ✅
- [ ] MemesSection component created with exact Figma styling
- [ ] Component integrated into main application (src/app/page.tsx)
- [ ] Component visible and functional in browser
- [ ] Debug system fully integrated (labels, borders, grid overlay)
- [ ] All SVG assets properly loaded and positioned
- [ ] PM verification completed with screenshot proof
- [ ] Integration commit provided with component usage

## Implementation Phase
- [ ] Create MemesSection component (`src/app/components/MemesSection.tsx`)
- [ ] Write comprehensive test suite (`src/app/components/__tests__/MemesSection.test.tsx`)
- [ ] Implement exact Figma specifications for layout and styling
- [ ] Add all required SVG assets and positioning
- [ ] Component functionality verified in isolation

## Integration Phase - CRITICAL ⚠️
**This task is NOT complete until ALL integration steps are done:**

- [ ] Import MemesSection into src/app/page.tsx
- [ ] Add component to proper location in page layout
- [ ] Replace any existing placeholder/hardcoded content
- [ ] Verify component renders correctly in full application
- [ ] Test responsive behavior in browser
- [ ] Confirm proper z-index layering with other sections

## Debug System Integration - MANDATORY
- [ ] Add `debug-image` classes to all SVG elements
- [ ] Add `data-filename` attributes for debug labels
- [ ] Ensure SVG borders show when debug borders enabled
- [ ] Test grid overlay alignment on section
- [ ] Verify debug console controls affect this section

## Technical Requirements

### Section Structure (From Figma Analysis)
```
memes-section (full width container)
├── background-elements (gradients, decorative SVGs)
├── main-content-area
│   ├── section-title/header
│   ├── memes-grid/layout
│   └── interactive-elements
└── decorative-elements (positioned absolutely)
```

### Asset Requirements
**All SVG files must be verified to exist in figma-exports:**
- [ ] Verify all meme-related SVG files are in public/figma-exports/
- [ ] Check character SVGs needed for this section
- [ ] Confirm background/decoration SVGs are available
- [ ] Test SVG loading paths in component

### Styling Requirements
- [ ] Match exact colors from Figma design
- [ ] Implement proper spacing and dimensions
- [ ] Add hover states and interactions as specified
- [ ] Ensure section inherits main application background gradient
- [ ] Test responsive breakpoints

## Integration Testing Requirements
**BEFORE marking task complete, verify:**
- [ ] Section appears in correct position on main page
- [ ] Scrolling behavior works properly
- [ ] Section doesn't conflict with existing sections
- [ ] Background gradients flow properly between sections
- [ ] All interactive elements work in full application context

## Verification Checklist - PM APPROVAL REQUIRED
- [ ] Screenshot of section working in full application
- [ ] Screenshot of debug labels showing on section elements
- [ ] Screenshot of responsive behavior
- [ ] Confirmation all SVGs are loading properly
- [ ] Manual testing of all interactive elements
- [ ] Code review of integration implementation

## Root Cause Prevention
**To avoid previous integration failures:**
1. **Component AND Integration**: Both phases must be complete
2. **Browser Testing**: Must test in actual running application
3. **Visual Verification**: PM must see working screenshots
4. **Debug Integration**: Debug system must work on new section
5. **No Shortcuts**: Cannot mark complete without integration

## Technical Implementation Details
- **Framework**: Next.js with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom Figma colors
- **Images**: Next.js Image component with SVG optimization
- **Testing**: Jest + React Testing Library + Browser testing
- **Debug**: Full integration with existing debug system
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first responsive design

---
**PM Notes**: Using improved task process. This task will NOT be marked complete until the section is actually visible and working in the main application with full debug system integration. No more "completed but not integrated" failures.
