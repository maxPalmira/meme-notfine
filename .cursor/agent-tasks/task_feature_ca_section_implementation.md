# Task: CA Section Implementation

## Task Type: feature
**Created**: 2025-01-21  
**Status**: IN_PROGRESS  
**Assigned Branch**: feature/ca-section-implementation  
**Priority**: High  

## Objective
Implement the CA (Contract Address) section with proper styling, copy functionality, and responsive design to match Figma specifications exactly.

## Progress Update
**Commit**: 618885b - "feat: implement CA section component with comprehensive test suite"
**Date**: 2025-01-21

### Completed ✅
- [x] Set up Jest testing framework with React Testing Library  
- [x] Created CASection component with exact Figma styling
- [x] Implemented copy functionality with visual feedback
- [x] Added custom Tailwind classes for Figma colors and shadows
- [x] Component matches exact dimensions and positioning
- [x] Proper responsive design with max-width and overflow handling
- [x] Visual feedback for copy success/error states
- [x] Hover effects and transitions implemented

### Test Results: 9/14 Passing ✅
**Passing Tests:**
- ✅ renders the CA section with correct structure
- ✅ displays the contract address with correct styling  
- ✅ has correct dimensions and positioning
- ✅ renders CA button with cream background and black border
- ✅ renders copy button with red background and shadow
- ✅ shows visual feedback when address is copied
- ✅ uses Jua font family
- ✅ has correct font sizes
- ✅ is responsive on smaller screens

**Failing Tests (Need Fixes):**
- ❌ copies contract address to clipboard when clicking the address (clipboard mocking issue)
- ❌ copies contract address to clipboard when clicking copy button (clipboard mocking issue)  
- ❌ handles clipboard errors gracefully (test expects error but gets success)
- ❌ has proper accessibility attributes (missing role attribute on address element)
- ❌ supports keyboard navigation (clipboard mocking issue)

### Next Steps 🔄
1. Fix clipboard mock in test environment
2. Restore accessibility attributes to address element
3. Fix error handling test expectations
4. Complete remaining test fixes
5. Integrate component into main page
