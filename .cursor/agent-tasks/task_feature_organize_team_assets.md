## Objective
Move team section image assets from `public/figma-exports/raw/` to appropriate organized subfolders. This section contains character illustrations.

## Scope: Team Section
The team section contains:
1. Character illustrations (cats)
2. Team-related decorative elements

## Assets to Move

### Character Illustrations → characters/
Move these files from `raw/` to `characters/`:
- `team-cat-rocket.svg`
- `©cat-relax.svg`

## Implementation Requirements

### CRITICAL: Use MOVE Commands Only
- **NEVER use copy + delete operations**
- **NEVER use rm/remove commands**
- Use `mv` command to move files from source to destination
- Example: `mv public/figma-exports/raw/team-cat-rocket.svg public/figma-exports/characters/team-cat-rocket.svg`

### Verification Steps
1. Confirm all 2 files are moved successfully
2. Verify raw folder no longer contains these specific files
3. Verify destination folders contain the moved files
4. Test that file paths are accessible

### Implementation Steps
1. Move character assets to characters folder
2. Verify all moves completed successfully
3. Update this task with completion status

## Technical Notes
- All files are SVG format
- Note special character in `©cat-relax.svg` (keep as-is)
- Maintain exact file names during move
- Preserve file permissions
- Work from repository root directory

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] 2 character assets moved to `public/figma-exports/characters/`
- [ ] No files remain in raw folder that belong to team section
- [ ] All moved files are accessible at new paths
- [ ] No duplicate files created during process

## Next Steps
This continues the systematic organization of all website sections.
