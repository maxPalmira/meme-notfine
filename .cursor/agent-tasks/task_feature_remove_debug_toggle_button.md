---

## Overview
Remove the DEBUG toggle button from the top-left corner of the page. The button should be completely removed from the UI since debug functionality is now handled through the config console.

## Execution Mode: AUTONOMOUS with Strategic Checkpoints
- **Autonomous**: Environment setup, code changes, testing, screenshots
- **Confirmation Required**: After initial analysis (Step 4), before final commit
- **‚õî HARD STOPS**: Git workflow issues, environment failures, external dependency problems

## Error Classification System
- üî¥ **HARD STOP**: Git conflicts, server won't start, core functionality broken
- üü° **PROCEED WITH CAUTION**: Linting warnings, test failures in unrelated components  
- üü¢ **CONTINUE**: Missing optional dependencies with workarounds available

## Cost Control Measures
- **Max debugging iterations**: 3 attempts before escalation
- **Debugging Attempt Definition**: Each cycle of modify code ‚Üí test ‚Üí verify ‚Üí screenshot
- **Reset counter**: After successful partial completion
- **Screenshot limit**: Exactly 3 final images (no debugging screenshots)
- **External dependency timeout**: 30 minutes before escalation
- **Task time limit**: 1 hour maximum

## PRE-EXECUTION PHASE

### Step 0: Git Workflow Validation ‚ö†Ô∏è MANDATORY ‚úÖ COMPLETED
```bash
# Verify current branch and sync
git branch                           # Confirm current branch
git checkout development            # Switch to base branch  
git pull origin development         # Pull latest changes
git checkout -b cursor/feature-remove-debug-toggle-button  # Create feature branch
git status                          # Confirm clean working directory
```
**‚úÖ Git workflow confirmed clean - on feature branch `cursor/remove-debug-toggle-button-feature-1c8c`**

### Step 1: Environment Health Check ‚úÖ COMPLETED
```bash
# Verify core environment
node --version                      # Verify Node.js available
npm --version                       # Verify npm available
npm install                         # Install dependencies
npm run build                       # Verify build works
npm test                           # Run existing tests

# Verify screenshot tools
npx playwright install              # Install browsers for screenshots
npx playwright --version           # Verify Playwright available

# Start development server
npm run dev                        # Should start without errors
# Verify server runs on http://localhost:3000
```

**Environment Dependencies:**
- ‚úÖ Node.js + npm (verified - v22.16.0/10.9.2)
- ‚úÖ Playwright with browser installation
- ‚úÖ Development server port availability (3000)
- ‚úÖ Screenshots directory (created)

### Step 2: External Dependencies Verification ‚úÖ COMPLETED
```bash
# Check browser console for errors (http://localhost:3000)
# Verify all external scripts load correctly
# Check for any React hydration issues
# Confirm debug functionality works via config console
```
**‚úÖ Server running correctly, config console functional**

### Step 3: Take BEFORE Screenshot ‚úÖ COMPLETED
```bash
# With development server running at http://localhost:3000
# Use Playwright for focused screenshots (top-left corner only):
npx playwright screenshot --viewport-size=1200,800 --clip=0,0,400,300 http://localhost:3000 screenshots/before-debug-toggle-button.png
# Focus on top-left corner where DEBUG button appears
```
**‚úÖ BEFORE screenshot captured showing DEBUG button**

### Step 4: Analysis Summary ‚úÖ COMPLETED

**Current State Identified:**
- ‚úÖ Debug toggle button location: `src/app/components/DebugToggle.tsx` line 70
- ‚úÖ Button rendering method: JSX component in `src/app/page.tsx` line 36
- ‚úÖ Associated styling: Fixed positioning `top-4 left-4` with green styling

**Implementation Plan:**
1. ‚úÖ Located DEBUG toggle button in component tree
2. ‚úÖ Removed button JSX/component reference from `page.tsx`
3. ‚úÖ Removed associated import statement
4. ‚úÖ Tested that debug functionality still works via config console
5. ‚úÖ Verified no broken references remain

**‚úÖ Before screenshot captured**: Shows DEBUG button in top-left corner

---

## IMPLEMENTATION PHASE ‚úÖ COMPLETED

### Step 5: Code Implementation ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- ‚úÖ Located DEBUG toggle button in `src/app/page.tsx`
- ‚úÖ Removed `import DebugToggle from "./components/DebugToggle";` 
- ‚úÖ Removed `<DebugToggle />` component usage
- ‚úÖ Removed associated comment
- ‚úÖ Ensured debug functionality remains available via config console

### Step 6: Testing & Validation ‚úÖ COMPLETED
```bash
# Verify component renders correctly
npm run dev

# Check for console errors
# Test that debug functionality works via config console
# Verify button is completely removed from UI
```
**‚úÖ Application runs correctly, DEBUG button removed, config console functional**

### Step 7: Screenshot Documentation ‚úÖ COMPLETED (Exactly 3 Total)
```bash
# Use Playwright for focused screenshots (top-left corner area)
# 1. BEFORE screenshot (already taken in Step 3)

# 2. AFTER - button removed (same top-left corner area)
npx playwright screenshot --viewport-size=1200,800 --clip=0,0,400,300 http://localhost:3000 screenshots/AFTER-button-removed.png

# 3. AFTER - debug console still works
npx playwright screenshot --viewport-size=1200,800 --clip=0,0,1200,400 http://localhost:3000 screenshots/AFTER-debug-console-functional.png
```

**Screenshot Requirements:**
1. ‚úÖ **BEFORE-button.png**: Shows DEBUG button in top-left corner
2. ‚úÖ **AFTER-removed.png**: Same area with no DEBUG button
3. ‚úÖ **AFTER-console.png**: Debug console working correctly

**‚úÖ Button removal clearly visible in before/after comparison**

## Files to Examine and Modify
- ‚úÖ Searched for DEBUG button in main components (found in `page.tsx`)
